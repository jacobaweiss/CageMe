Cage Me
=======
Placeholder images, starring Nicolas Cage
-----------------------------------------

After enjoying kittens and pugs in our Campfire chat via Hubot, I decided that the phrase 'Cage me!' should become commonplace.  In the fashion of [placekitten](http://placekitten.com/) and [placedog](http://placedog.com/), Nicolas Cage can now grace your site wireframes and mockups in any dimensions you so choose.

Images are pulled from:

*http://niccageaseveryone.blogspot.com/
*http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nic-cage-as-everyone/photos

Please let me know if you are the creator/owner of any images and would like them removed.

Many thanks to the [placedog source code](https://github.com/JGaudette/PlaceDog), without which I'd have been lost on this one.

This is still a work in progress, so please post in [Issues](https://github.com/jacobaweiss/CageMe/issues) if you would like to contribute or contact me.
